	<div class="paragraph"><h2>The best way to get to know their personalities is to watch them in interviews. They are comedic gold in my opinion and my absolute favorite interview of theirs is when they appeard on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTgoAmTprZ0">Weekly Idol</a> back in 2017.</h2></div>

		 <div class="paragraph"><h2>While they all may seem nice and collected they all are super funny and loud. Even Jinyoung, the most put together character, can hardly keep his composure when Yugyeom annoys him.</h2></div>
	<ul><h2 id="groupDynamic"> Here is the groups dynamic:</h2></ul>
		<h3><li>JB: Very much the tired father of GOT7. He tries to get his kids in control but they hardly listen</li>
		<li>Jinyoung: The mother of the group. He takes care of the members the most and has a bit more control over them. Calls the rest of the members "The Kids". Does lots of typical mother things. He even said so himself that he is the mother of the group.</li>
		<li>Mark: It's hard to say, he sometimes acts as the oldest brother but at other times he acts as the youngest brother. He is pretty reserved and quite, but when he becomes less shy he gets just as loud as the rest of the group.</li>
		<li>Jackson: He really acts like a middle child in my opinion. I don't know why. He just radiates middle child energy to me.</li>
		<li>Yugyeom, BamBam, Youngjae: they all act like the youngest siblings. Incredibly hyper, love to annoy their older members, and just the loudest of the group. BamBam and Yugyeom especially love to test JB's and Jinyoung's limits.</li>
